# Sensor App
### Challenge that I have faced
- To Inserting the record of the sensor values in the android SQLite DB every 5 minutes. I have worked with SQLite before but the problem that I faced to make this app is to inserting the sensor value every specific time. I didn't get a proper solution or any hints over the internet that make sense to me to solve the problem. Though I had written the code from my little knowledge to inserting sensor values every 5 minutes into the SQLite database it didn't work for me.
