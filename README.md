# Sensor App
### Challenge that I have faced
- To Inserting the record of the sensor values in the android SQLite DB every 5 minutes. I have worked with SQLite before but the problem that I faced to make this app is to inserting the sensor value every specific time. I didn't get a proper solution or any hints over the internet that make sense to me to solve the problem. Though I had written the code from my little knowledge to inserting sensor values every 5 minutes into the SQLite database it didn't work for me.
- The problem that I have faced is to run the service in the background with notification. The problem was while I was running the service in the background with notification. It was working with notification but while I tried to display the 4 Realtime value to the notification I called the notification function into the onSensorChanged function and the notification calling in every updated value and while I removing the notification by swipe notification getting called again and again and notification bell ringing continuously that was annoying. I didnâ€™t get the proper logic that where  I can call the notification function once that will displaye every Realtime values .
